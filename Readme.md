# 🌱 Embedded & IoT Learning Journey – Weekend Edition

👋 Hi! This is my weekend learning log as I level up from hobbyist to AI-proof embedded systems engineer.  
I’m exploring hardware, low-level firmware, IoT communication, edge AI, and building real-world resilient systems.

## 🛤️ Journey Timeline

| Month | Focus Area | Key Outcomes |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1–2 | Sensor integration, GPIO, I2C, SPI | Built basic sensor dashboard, learned signal integrity |
| 3–4 | Debugging, logging, power monitoring | Added SD logging + power stats, handled sensor failure |
| 5–6 | MQTT, cloud dashboards, OTA control | Remote control pump via cloud, Vue dashboard live |
| 7–8 | RTOS, deep sleep, power resilience | Tasks for sensing + control, solar/battery powered |
| 9–10 | Edge AI w/ Edge Impulse | Deployed model to predict soil dryness locally |
| 11–12 | Productize + docs + showcase | Offline sync, OTA fallback, project published |
